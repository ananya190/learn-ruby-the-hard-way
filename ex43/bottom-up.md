1. Take a small piece of the problem; hack on some code and get it to run barely.
2. Refine the code into something more formal with classes and automated tests.
3. Extract the key concepts you're using to and try to find research for them.
4. Write a description of what's really going on.
5. Go back and refine the code, possibly throwing it out and starting over.
6. Repeat, moving on to some other piece of the problem.
