# INHERITANCE

## Use inheritance sparingly!

most uses of inheritance can be simplified or replaced with composition

There are three ways of implementing inheritance:

+ Actions on the child imply an acion on the parent
+ Actions on the child override an action on the parent
+ Actions on the child alter the action on the parent
